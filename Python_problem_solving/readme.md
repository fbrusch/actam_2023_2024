# Lesson 2: Coding for problem solving and exploration

* we’ll use python to demonstrate how it is possible to approach a programming language starting with a problem, and then trying to solve it
* this approach is complementary with that of starting to learn the language (syntax, semantics etc), and then solving problems
---
* it is not better or worse, it is just *another* approach that I want to show to you
* we'll use a REPL, that is an interface that stands for:
    * Read: read an expression (a text/string!)
    * Evaluate: interpret the expression and turn it into a *value*
    * Print: print the expression
    * Loop: start over
---
* We are not using coding/programming languages to create an application that somebody else will use
* We will use coding to “explore” ideas, automate boring things, etc
* We will use jupyter notebooks
