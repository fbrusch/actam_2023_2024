# Exploratory problem solving 
### (with Python)

* In this lesson we’ll use Python to demonstrate how it is possible to approach a programming language starting with a problem, and then trying to solve it
* This approach is complementary with that of starting to learn the language (syntax, semantics etc), and then solving problems
* It is not _better_ or _worse_, it is just *another* approach that I want to show to you

---
- Here we’ll have a REPL, that is an interface that stands for:
* Read: read an expression (a text/string!)
* Evaluate: interpret the expression and turn it into a *value*
* Print: print the expression
* Loop: start over

---
 - We are not using coding/programming languages to create an application that somebody else will use
* We will use coding to “explore” ideas, automate boring things, etc
* We will use jupyter notebooks

# The problem

- There are 30 persons in a room
* Would you bet that at least two of them has the same birthday?
