# Introduction

Some basic questions you might have:

* What does _coding_ mean?
* What is our goal?
* What _tools_ will we learn to use?
* What _methodologies_?
* How will you be evaluated?

## Coding

* What do me mean with “coding”? Is the same as “programming”?

* It is difficult to find a precise, agreed upon definition

* What are programming languages main uses?
* Are they useful? Are they worth learning/mastering?
* If so, why?

## Implementing Applications

The main, and most famous use of programming languages, is to implement computer applications.
An application, as we know, is a computer program that performs a certain task, or offer some functionality to users.
One codified process to develop computer applications is the so called _waterfall model_.

The waterfall model is by now, with its sharply defined phases, an extremism
Real development methods blur phases and introduce loops
The interesting things is: code is written during implementation, and it strictly follows a phase in which is decided, with other means, “what to do”.
A programming language is, in this vision, merely a technology with which to implement some behavior defined before.
The question is: can code be used differently? Can it play another role?

In C, the only way to deal with the code you’re writing, is to compile it, execute it, and then interact with the running process, as a user. The “code writing” and “interaction” phases are strictly separated.
But this kind of interaction is not the only possible!
Always more often, for many languages, another interaction mode is provided: _REPLs_

REPL stands for
* Read
* Evaluate
* Print
* Loop

Maybe you already worked with a REPL. One of the most widespread languages that offers a REPL is Matlab.
Another is Python. We’ll make a little experiment in using REPL Python to solve a problem in a little time.

---

In REPLs, you have a sort of a shell.
You can write an expression, that the shell READs.
The expression gets EVALUATEd.
The result is PRINTed.
The shell is ready to read another expression (LOOP).

```python

> 1+1
2
```

Meny new language offers a REPL. Why?
One reason is that they allow to learn the language much more easily.
The other is that it offers the possibility to use the language as an “exploratory tool”
In using code to explore the ideas, code is not just an implementation technology: it becomes an extension of the cognitive process of thinking about a problem!

There’s an even more extreme way of using code to explore ideas: code can be the language of a performance! Look at this video:

In this course, we will use code in different ways, with different purposes.
One of them will be to dynamically explore solution to problems.
But, for the main part, we will use code for something that stands between exploration and application development: we will use it for prototyping ideas
We will consider musical applications, such as sequencers, drum machines, etc.
We will learn new languages trying to develop prototypes of such applications
In the end, we will see how to engineer them, to get a final product.

## What languages will we use?

We will use mostly Javascript and Python
We’ll use Javascript in the context of the development of so called HTML5 applications.
There are different reason for this choice. The main ones are for Javascript are:
* It is a modern, evolving language that, despite some inconsistencies (that we’ll point out), offers some very powerful conceptual, and software engineering tools
* It is extremely _available_ (it runs in every browser!) 
* It allows to write applications that can be shared most easily (it suffices to have a browser)
* The fact that it runs in a browser makes it easy to augment applications with multi-user (e.g. collaborative) features (yes, we’ll experiment with that)
* In the browser context, it offers some powerful APIs for creating and manipulating sound

---

## Embedded Programming

We will use Javascript (and some Python) to program embedded devices, to experiment and tinker with physical interfaces

---

## Evaluation

* The evaluation will be based on the development of a project.
* The project will be a music/sound application, in html5, and/or a musical interface, developed with a prototyping platform
* The projects can be developed in conjunction with musical representation.
* More info will be available later on.
