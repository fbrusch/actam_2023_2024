## Coding

* What do me mean with “coding”? Is the same as “programming”?

* It is difficult to find a precise, agreed upon definition

* What are programming languages main uses?
* Are they useful? Are they worth learning/mastering?
* If so, why?

## Implementing Applications

The main, and most famous use of programming languages, is to implement computer applications.
An application, as we know, is a computer program that performs a certain task, or offer some functionality to users.
One codified process to develop computer applications is the so called _waterfall model_.
