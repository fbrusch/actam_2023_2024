**FAQ for the ACTAM project presentation and evaluation criteria**

**Q: Is it necessary to send code or other materials before the examination day?**

**A: No**. All materials should be delivered on the day of the exam, in the form of a repository accessible on a sharing platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, etc.). The expected content in the repository includes:
- The project code
- A readme.md that:
  - Explains the project's purpose (e.g., a sequencer with automatic generation of something, etc.). Why is the project useful/noteworthy?
  - Illustrates how it was implemented: with which technologies/libraries, and why
  - Discusses what the main challenges were, if any, and how they were addressed
  - Includes a video, possibly embedded, demonstrating the project's functionality
  - Contains a link to a page where the project is hosted and functional (the simplest way, as discussed in class, is through GitHub pages)

**Q: What about the presentation?**

**A: The presentation should:**
- Highlight the functionality offered by the application, and why it is useful or interesting
- Discuss the challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Include a live demo of the application

There are no constraints on the form of the presentation. Everyone is free to choose the format they believe best conveys the content (slides, oral presentation, use of the blackboard, etc.).

**Q: What are the evaulation criteria?**

**A: Evaluation criteria include:**
- The value of the idea. The sources of value can vary: an idea may be particularly original, another may be a classic (e.g., a drum machine) but executed exceptionally well or with innovative aspects, etc. Specific aspects of the projects have already been discussed in the reviews.
- Correct use of tools/technologies
- Estimation of the effort expended
- Quality and completeness of the documentation
- Overall impression of the execution (usability, etc.)
